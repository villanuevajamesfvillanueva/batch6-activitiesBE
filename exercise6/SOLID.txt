#SOLID Principles

#S - Single Responsibility Principle (class/method should be responsible for a small aspect only)
#O - Open/Closed Principle (should be open for extension and closed for modification)
#L - Liskov Substitution Principle (superclass method should be overridden by a subclass method for specificity)
#I - Interface Segregation Principle (segrerate methods that are not really of the 'same vibes')
#D - Dependency Inversion Principle
